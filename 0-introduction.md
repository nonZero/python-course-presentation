# Agenda

- What is Python
- Python Implementations
- Python 2 vs. Python 3
- Python Community



## What is Python

- A versatile Programming Language
- Used for small scripts, applications, games and heavy web servers
- Used since 1991 (22 years!)



## Python Programming Language

- Dynamic language
- Allows for clear short and elegant code
- There are preferred ways to solving common problems
- Often slower than compiled languages



## The Zen of Python

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- ...
- (type `import this` in the interpreter console)



## Main Python Implementations

- CPython
- Jython
- Iron Python
- PyPy



## Python 2 vs. Python 3

- Python 2 - the commonly used option
- Python 3 - tomorrow's version



## Why Python 3

- Will be the standard one day
- Automatically get new enhancements and improvements



## Why Python 2

- If you have to use 3'rd party libraries that do not support 3.



## What should I use?

Use Python 3 unless you need 3'rd party libraries that only run on Python 2



## Python Community

- The Python Software Foundation (PSF)
- PEP Mechanism
- The BDFL



## Guido Van Rossum
### AKA the BDFL
